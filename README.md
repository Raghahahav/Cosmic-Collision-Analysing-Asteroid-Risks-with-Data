Ah, I see the issue 👍 — your Markdown is rendering strangely because some **code blocks weren’t closed properly** and some headings got mixed inside code fences.

Here’s the **fixed Markdown** version (just copy–paste into your `README.md`):

# 🌌 Cosmic Collision: Analysing Asteroid Risks with Data  

## 📖 Overview  
This project applies **data analytics** and **machine learning** to assess the risks posed by asteroids approaching Earth.  
Using NASA’s asteroid close-approach dataset, the analysis predicts whether an asteroid is **potentially hazardous** based on features such as:  

- Estimated size and diameter  
- Orbital parameters  
- Velocity and relative speed  
- Proximity to Earth’s orbit  

The notebook covers: **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling** for asteroid risk classification.
